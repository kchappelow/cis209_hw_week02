Homework Assignment Week 2 - Due 9/20/2017 7:15 p.m.

Find the number of years.

Task #1: Using Eclipse, Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
minutes (e.g., 1 billion), and displays the number of years and days for the minutes.

Be sure to use comments and coding styles as discussed in class.

For simplicity, assume a year has 365 days. Here is a sample run:

```
Enter the number of years: 1000000000
1000000000 minutes is approximately 1902 years and 214 days.
```

Task #2: Run the program to make sure it works.

Task #3: Submit the homework using git.
